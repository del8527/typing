# typing

A simple website I made for users to practice and test their typing speed.
Will add more features soon!




















What I want to add in the future: 
- Auto generate words, quotes, etc.
- Option for the type test to end based on # of words or duration
- Accuracy counter at the end of the test (will require me to change how 'onFinish' functions)
- Better looking UI/UX, option to get a different quote / word list
- Different themes
