# typing

A simple website I made with react for users to practice and test their typing speed.
Will add more features soon!

While typing, your WPM will show. You can restart the test to try to get a better score.

If you mistype a letter, it will be highlighted red (you will need to delete what you mistyped, and retype it).



















What I want to add in the future: 
- Auto generate words, quotes, etc.
- Option for the type test to end based on # of words or duration
- Accuracy counter at the end of the test (will require me to change how 'onFinish' functions)
- Better looking UI/UX, option to get a different quote / word list
- Different themes
